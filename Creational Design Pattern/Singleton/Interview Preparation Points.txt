What is Singleton Pattern?

A design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout the application.

How to implement Singleton in Node.js?

Using module.exports or static class instance check.

Why use Singleton Pattern?

When shared resources are needed (e.g., Database Connection, Logger, Config).

How can Singleton be broken?

By cloning, dynamic imports, or separate Node.js processes.

How to prevent breaking?

Use Object.freeze(), export a single instance, or control imports strictly.

Real-world examples in Node.js:

require() caching system.

Database connection pool.

Logging system (Winston, Bunyan).

Configuration manager.
